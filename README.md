# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Deploying to our site

1. Run the `build` command as seen above.

2. Upload the contents of the /public/ folder to Cyberduck.

3. Open the `index.html` file of that folder in a text editor.

4. In WordPress, copy the CSS and JavaScript files present in that `index.html` file to the "External Resources" section of the WordPress editor. Whatever `<div>`s you're targeting with your app, make sure those are also present in the WordPress editor, too.
